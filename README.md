<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is a VR FPS game prototype with targets to shoot within 1.5 minutes. Each target has a unique ID and different points, the total score is updated on the canvas as targets are hit. The player performance data is also stored in JSON format which includes the total points scored, time taken to complete the game and time to hit each target. 

This project was developed for my bachelor's thesis "Effect of resolution on player performance and experience in low-fidelity virtual reality first-person shooting games" available at [DiVA](https://bth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1778716&dswid=1523) portal.
